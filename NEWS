===========================
PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT:
- Better handling of environments (currently non-existant)
- Better formula parsing
- Improvements to GUI in shiny_clme(), particularly:
  - Plots/summary for data when main response variable is not a factor
    or when there are multiple variables instead of a single factor
  - Add a "model running" indicator.
  - Allow more flexibility in file input (e.g. xlsx)


===========================
VERSION HISTORY:

Version 2.0-4, 2015-07-01
- Fixed error in logLik.clme.
- Changed maintainer email.
- Added explicit BIC.clme method (instead of forcing custom use of AIC.clme)
- Removed the bootstrap computations from clme() and put them into summary.clme(). 
- summary.clme() now returns a list of values (largely the same as clme()) but does not automatically print output to console.
- print.summary.clme() prints the output of summary.clme to the console.


Version 2.0-3, 2015-05-14
- Noted nsim is in the fitted object of clme().
- Fixed error with method VarCorr() (failed unless "lme4" or "nlme" was loaded, redefined method VarCorr)
- Replaced vignette with static document.
- Enabled parallel processing for bootstrap simulations, specify argument 'ncore'.
- Implemented work-around to prevent error (stemming from package isotone) when there was only 1 constraint.


Version 2.0-2, 2015-01-20
- Fixed typo in printing of log-likelihood, AIC, BIC
- Added ellipses to MINQUE function to prevent errors from arguments em.eps and em.iter
- Improvements to shiny_clme() application


Version 2.0-1, 2014-12-05
- Minor updates to several functions


Version 2.0-0, 2014-12-01
- Major changes to arguments, particularly:
  - Formula interface implemented
  - Removed necessity for custom PAVA algorithms (implemented function 'activeSet' from package isotone)
  - Nks replaced with group vector input
  - Qs removed, each random term now gets individual variance
- Provided more common methods for fitted objects

Version 1.0-0, 2014-09-09
- Initial release of package
